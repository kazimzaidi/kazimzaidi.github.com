When it comes to design, and particularly web design, I really think I can classify the entire world into three kinds of people:

Those who can design well. They know what a good design is made up of, and they've the skills to put one up. They are the kind of people who, by defintion, deserve to be called *designers*.

And then there are those who don't design, but they can definitely tell a good one from a bad one. They recognize well designed work, and they recognize poor design. They don't necessarily believe that everything has to be pixel perfect, but bad design certainly hurts them. If you show them a bad design, they can immediately point out to you that it's bad! But if you ask what should be done to improve it, they won't tell you anything. They are kind of common man. I really feel these are the kind of people who add to the positive energy of the world.

And then, the third kind is the most dangerous: they don't have a design sense! They call good design as bad, and bad design as good. If given control, they'll come up the poorest designs in the world, and the worst part is, they'll believe that they've made really good stuff. Remember the people from old days who'd put **marquee** and **blink** tags on their website, and feel good about it? Yes. These are the kind of people who must be avoided at all costs. And if you got one in place of your manager or client, I already start to feel pity for you.

Given that I don't really design, I feel I belong to the second category. What do you think?
